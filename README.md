# üß† Self Check Extractor for RAISE Curriculum 

This script extracts **Self Check questions** from the [RAISE Math K‚Äì12 curriculum](https://www.raise.education), including:

It normalizes corrupted characters (e.g. `‚â•`, `‚â§`, `‚àí`) to clean LaTeX-style MathJax syntax, ensuring compatibility with rendering engines and CSV tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The script:

1. Parses `toc.md` to identify all "Self Check" questions
2. Extracts question stems from individual HTML files
3. Extracts answers and feedback from associated `lesson.xml` files
4. Cleans corrupted symbols and exports a structured CSV
